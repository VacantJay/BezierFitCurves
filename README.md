# BezierFitCurves

Using Swift implement of Philip J. Schneider's "An Algorithm for Automatically Fitting Digitized Curves"

Adaptively fit a set of 2D points with one or more cubic Bezier curves.

And the Swift implementations refer to [fitCurves](https://github.com/sikasjc/fitCurves.git) and the original C++ code.

And the Demo app refer to [LxThroughPointsBezier](https://github.com/DeveloperLx/LxThroughPointsBezier.git)
